Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions within a highly imbalanced dataset using machine learning models. Key steps include data preprocessing, class balancing with SMOTE, and model building with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Key Features:
Class Balancing: Addressed severe class imbalance using SMOTE.
Modeling: Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized Random Forest using GridSearchCV, achieving 99.95% accuracy.
Feature Importance: Identified top features contributing to fraud detection.
Results:
The final Random Forest model delivered exceptional performance, with balanced precision and recall, making it suitable for real-world fraud detection systems.
